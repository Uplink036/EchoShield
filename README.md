# EchoShield
## Introduction

This project aims to develop a reinforcement learning-based filter that confuses ASR models, like OpenAI’s Whisper, while remaining intelligible to humans. We will compare its effectiveness across multiple ASR systems and explore both static (e.g., band-pass filters) and dynamic (e.g., RL-based) defense mechanisms against such adversarial attacks.
